# Create and deploy a Swift Kitura application

> We have applications available for [Node.js Express](https://github.com/IBM/node-express-app), [Go Gin](https://github.com/IBM/go-gin-app), [Python Flask](https://github.com/IBM/python-flask-app), [Python Django](https://github.com/IBM/python-django-app), [Java Spring](https://github.com/IBM/java-spring-app), [Java Liberty](https://github.com/IBM/java-liberty-app), [Swift Kitura](https://github.com/IBM/swift-kitura-app), [Android](https://github.com/IBM/android-app), and [iOS](https://github.com/IBM/ios-app).

In this sample application, you will create a basic web application using [Kitura](https://www.kitura.io/) to serve web pages in Swift, complete with standard best practices, including a health check.

## Steps


### Deploying to IBM Cloud

[IBM Cloud DevOps](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/devops) services provides toolchains as a set of tool integrations that support development, deployment, and operations tasks inside IBM Cloud.

### Building Locally

To get started building this application locally, you can either run the application natively or use the [IBM Cloud Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started) for containerization and easy deployment to IBM Cloud.

#### Native Application Development

- On Linux, install the [Swift toolchain](https://swift.org/) version _v5.1_.
- On macOS, install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/download) _v11+_

In the root of this project, first build the application using `swift build`. `swift run` will launch the application and render it at `http://localhost:8080`. You can also verify the state of your locally running application using the Selenium UI test script included in the `scripts` directory.

#### IBM Cloud Developer Tools

Install [IBM Cloud Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started) on your machine by running the following command:
```
curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash
```

Create an application on IBM Cloud by running:

```bash
ibmcloud dev create
```

This will create and download a starter application with the necessary files needed for local development and deployment.

Your application will be compiled with Docker containers. To compile and run your app, run:

```bash
ibmcloud dev build
ibmcloud dev run
```

This will launch your application locally. When you are ready to deploy to IBM Cloud on Kubernetes, run one of the commands:

```bash
ibmcloud dev deploy -t container // to K8s cluster
```

You can build and debug your app locally with:

```bash
ibmcloud dev build --debug
ibmcloud dev debug
```

## Next Steps
* Learn more about augmenting your Swift applications on IBM Cloud with the [Swift Programming Guide](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/swift?topic=swift-getting-started).
* Explore [Kitura.io](https://www.kitura.io/) for more resources about the Kitura framework.
* Join the [Swift@IBM slack](http://swift-at-ibm-slack.mybluemix.net/) to get help with your projects.
