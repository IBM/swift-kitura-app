# Create and deploy a Swift Kitura Application

> We have similar applications available for [Node.js](https://github.com/IBM/nodejs-web-app), [Java Spring](https://github.com/IBM/spring-web-app), [Go](https://github.com/IBM/go-web-app), Python [Django](https://github.com/IBM/django-web-app) & [Flask](https://github.com/IBM/flask-web-app), and [Java Liberty](https://github.com/IBM/java-liberty-web-app).

In this sample application, you will create a basic web application using [Kitura](https://www.kitura.io/) to serve web pages in Swift, complete with standard best practices, including a health check.

## Steps

You can [deploy this application to IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/developer/appservice/create-app?starterKit=fa97ca34-d257-358a-ba37-f53e566bbef9) or [build it locally](#building-locally) by cloning this repo first. Once your app is live, you can access the `/health` endpoint to build out your cloud native application.

### Deploying to IBM Cloud

</p>

Click **Deploy to IBM Cloud** to deploy this same application to IBM Cloud. This option creates a deployment pipeline, complete with a hosted GitLab project and a DevOps toolchain. You can deploy your app to Cloud Foundry, a Kubernetes cluster, or a Red Hat OpenShift cluster. OpenShift is available only through a standard cluster, which requires you to have a billable account.

[IBM Cloud DevOps](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/devops) services provides toolchains as a set of tool integrations that support development, deployment, and operations tasks inside IBM Cloud.

### Building Locally

To get started building this application locally, you can either run the application natively or use the [IBM Cloud Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started) for containerization and easy deployment to IBM Cloud.

#### Native Application Development

- On Linux, install the [Swift toolchain](https://swift.org/) version _v5.1_.
- On macOS, install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/download) _v11+_

In the root of this project, first build the application using `swift build`. `swift run` will launch the application and render it at `http://localhost:8080`.

#### IBM Cloud Developer Tools

Install [IBM Cloud Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started) on your machine by running the following command:
```
curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash
```

Create an application on IBM Cloud by running:

```bash
ibmcloud dev create
```

This will create and download a starter application with the necessary files needed for local development and deployment.

Your application will be compiled with Docker containers. To compile and run your app, run:

```bash
ibmcloud dev build
ibmcloud dev run
```

This will launch your application locally. When you are ready to deploy to IBM Cloud on Cloud Foundry or Kubernetes, run one of the commands:

```bash
ibmcloud dev deploy -t buildpack // to Cloud Foundry
ibmcloud dev deploy -t container // to K8s cluster
```

You can build and debug your app locally with:

```bash
ibmcloud dev build --debug
ibmcloud dev debug
```
